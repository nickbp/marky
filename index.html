<p>Marky is a library for creating Markov chains from arbitrary text input. It comes with a simple command line front end, named <i>marky-file</i>, which can be used for reading text files and producing entertaining output.</p>

<p>The library is divided into several discrete components, allowing developers and advanced users to customize and extend its functionality. It currently supports a few scoring and selection methods, and temporary (hash map) or persistent (SQLite) storage of its state. For details of its structure, take a look at the <a href="docs.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>It's also fairly fast. In a Release build on my 3 year old laptop, the <i>marky-file</i> tool imports all of "My Antonia" and produces a chain in about 0.2 seconds. If the data is imported into a SQLite db (~3 seconds), it takes around 0.1 seconds per chain from that. Here are some examples:</p>
