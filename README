THIS PROJECT HAS MOVED TO SOURCEHUT!: https://sr.ht/~nickbp/marky/

I'm consolidating my personal projects in one place. As such the old GitHub repo is being archived, and work now continues on sourcehut.

===

Building marky:

1) Optionally install libsqlite3-dev
2) "mkdir bin; cd bin"
3) "cmake .."
4) "make"
5) See "bin/apps/marky-file" or "py/example.py"
