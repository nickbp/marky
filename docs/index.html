<p>Marky is a library for creating Markov chains from arbitrary text input. It comes with a simple command line front end, named <i>marky-file</i>, which can be used to read text files and produce entertaining output.</p>

<p>The library is divided into several discrete components, allowing developers and advanced users to easily customize and extend its behavior. It currently supports a few scoring and selection methods, and temporary (hash map) or persistent (SQLite) storage of its state. For a description of Marky's internal structure, take a look at the <a href="docs.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>It's also pretty fast. In a Release build on my 3 year old laptop, the <i>marky-file</i> tool imports all of "My Antonia" and produces a chain in about 0.25 seconds. If the data is imported into a SQLite db (~3 seconds), it takes around 0.1 seconds to produce a chain from that. Here are some examples:</p>
